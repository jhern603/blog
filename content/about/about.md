I am a veteran of the US Army Reserves, a hobby photographer, Software Engineer, and Biomedical Engineer in my past life.

I like to play video games with my friends in my free time, contribute to local-community driven events, and also looking into getting into getting flying certification in the future.

I am a student at Florida International University, and three-time Oracle intern. (Just refer to me as Senior Intern hehe)
