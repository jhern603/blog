## Ch 0) Preamble
There's truly no coherent purpose to this post. This is in essence a vomit of what is on my mind. A vomit that includes my emotions, anxiety, and just general thoughts.

If you decide to read this, then I wish you the best of luck on this journey. I will likely not proofread this post, nor do I intend to.


## Ch 1) Anxiety and Depression
The month of January started off... Somewhat happily. I started the year with confidence that everything was going perfectly, yet, as the month progressed, it turned into a deep spiral downward. I started developing romantic feelings for a person whom I think sees me as nothing more than an acquaintance. A family member passed away from a cardiac arrest, after enduring a 72 hour PSV. My finances are also taking a perfect 90 degree downward fall. The combination of these three things have felt like I slammed into a wall. If I were in a car going 110mph and somehow survived, that is.

I used to think that I would never suffer from depression, yet here I am. There have been moments in my early life where I did contemplate suicide, but I took that as a form of escapism. This is different. Much, much different. Now, I don't even have the energy to stand up in the mornings to _take my depression medications_.

There was one night where I was ingesting so much information that it felt like I was being fed information through a firehose. This information isn't necessairly useful to my everyday life; though it is useful to know because it changes how I treat the people involved. On top of that, I let something slip my mind. I said something that hurt the person I have feelings for. That sent me deeper into the depths of hell. There was two nights where I didn't want to do *anything.* Not eat, drink water, shower, or do *any basic human necessities.* I wanted to die. Yet, for some reason, the thought, or impulse to even attempt it didn't cross my mind. I felt close to picking up the phone and dialing the mental health crisis hotline, yet I didn't. I kept telling myself, "it's okay, it's just a person, you're okay. You can keep living." Yet, it felt like it wasn't enough.

I kept kicking myself harer as I thought, "she will never talk to me again in my life. She probably feels resentment for me. What am I good for anyways?" Those thoughts were overpowering. I went to work the next day as usual, hiding all of my emotions, enduring all of my negativity. Then I talked to some of my friends. We eventually went out separate ways for the day. I got home and tried to destress by playing some video games. I couldn't. Even turning on my computer made it feel like I ran a mental ultramarathon. I didn't know what to do. I felt alone. I felt like there was nothing, nobody to care for me. I knew that was a lie, yet I couldn't convince myself otherwise.

Here comes the weekend. Great, 2 full days of nothing but me being stuck with my own thoughts. "This is going to be worse than a  mental hell," I thought. I had to find a way to distract myself. I started doing some chores. I finished those quicker than I thought I could. I decided, let me do something that I know takes a while. I started washing my car. All of a sudden, I felt my phone vibrate in my pocket. It was her. "Oh god no, this is it for me. This is when I should just bury myself, mentally and physically." Yet to my surprise, it was less-taxing that I thought it would be. I interpreted the message as she was open to giving me another chance. I replied with the most heartfelt apology I have ever done. It felt like I was physically breaking open my chest and handing it to her, as if to say, "please, forgive me." I felt like an abused dog. I felt as if I was getting a chance at life again.

"i can’t say it’s okay, but i can say, im glad you saw the error in that." Every word in that sentence hit me like a freight train. I knew what I said was insensitive. I knew that I shouldn't have even thought about that word. Yet, it had left me that night. As I took time to process the following messages, I started becoming teary eyed. I was crying. I hadn't cried because of emotional pain in years. I had forgotten what it felt like to cry. I felt some form of relief. She overlooked what I had said. She accepted my apology. I... Felt like I was reborn. Not because of an apology, but because I remembered what it was like ot have emotions again.

I never considered to have been completely heartless. Yet, in a way I was. My entire personality was reformed when I was in Iraq. I didn't notice it, nobody around me at the time noticed. Yet, my mother noticed it when I came back. She never said  anything, though. I went on for 4 years thinking, "I'm okay, everyone around me is just too emotional." Yet, this was the moment that broke that for me. This was the moment that brought me back down to Earth.

I was hurt and relieved at the same time. I was deeply hurt because of the thought that I hurt someone that I supposedly loved. I was relieved because of the thought that I was hurt.

From there on, I felt like my personality started changing again. This time, emotions were being introduced. Nervousness, happiness, sadness. Emotions I haven't felt in so long. It felt refreshing.

## Ch 2) Finances
Here I am. I "started" a new job, I graduated college, I left the Army. Yet my finances was taking a decline almost as fast as my mental sanity. I thought this year would be the end of financial struggles. Instead, it started with financial struggles. I started looking at financial support initiatives, especially for housing. *All* of them have the same top requirement. "Must have received an eviction notice." Why are these programs designed to help you when it's practically too late? All I need is time.

Yet time is what I don't have. My finances are all depenendany on one person saying, "there's enoguh money for that." I waited, and waited, and waited, the end of the month is here. Nothing. I start looking at other positions. I look at taking back my old job. In either case, they may not get me the money that I need to pay my bills. I bring this up to my director. He begins to understand the gravity of the situation.

"If I don't hear back by Wednesday, I'll speak to the director of the school," he says. Surely, that will get the ball rolling. However, there's still uncertainty in that statement. I decided to apply to my old job. Within 4 hours, I get a call to schedule an interview. I conduct the interview and had a great time with an old co-worker who will possibly be my manager. It seems like this position will get me started faster than my previously promised positiion.

This chapter is to be continued...

## Ch 3) Love
Love is an emotion everyone holds dearly. Love is one that I've shown, yet never received. I don't truly know what "love" is. Is it to want someone else all to yourself? Is it to want to be with them until the end of time? Is it to start a family? These can all be "correct" answers. Yet, none of them is correct for me. I don't know what the correct answer is. All I know is that I feel it. I know when to distinguish it from lust. I know when to distinguish it from gluttony, and the other cardinal sins. Yet, it also feels like a cardinal sin in itself to even discuss about it.

I want to discuss it, especially with the one I "love." Yet, I can't build up the courage to do it. I know that the worst outcome is just a simple no, or that my feelings don't get reciprocated. Yet, it's the fear of just that happening that prevents me from actually saying anything.

How does this make sense? It shouldn't. I'm conciously aware of it, yet I'd rather crawl into a hole and hide. Is this what is like to be in love? How can people do it? The full on irony is that I should know full well how this works. I've literally played cupid for two people before. But it's because of the fact that I know of what can happen, that I don't want to admit it.

Every look at her feels like God's given grace just coming down and embracing me. Every embrace from her, no matter how brief, makes me feel like I can just let it all go and sink deep into her. Every word spoken from her mouth just seems to sooth my soul. The thought of having her to me and having a family with her, being with her through all of life's challenges and waltz just makes me want to admit it more and more. Every strand of hair, freckle, hell, even her skin imperfections. They just make her seem perfect. Yet, I can't draw myself to even utter the words "I love you," even as a friend. She may not sense it, or accept it, yet every time I talk to her, it feels like I'm approaching nirvana. 

Should I perhaps throw it all out and practice misogi like some Japanese do to rid themself of wordly desires? Should I just live a life where I am the last generation of my bloodline? I don't want that.

What is stopping me, then? Is it the fear of rejection, is it the fear that she'll ostricize me? Is it possibly the fact that we won't even be able to see eachother the same ever again?

I've gotten close to saying "I love you" to her, yet I've pulled myself back by miles. I've said things that I've intended her to pick up on as attempts to advance, yet I'm too terrified to confirm it. I feel that if I _were_ to say "I love you," it'll be brushed off as an act of adoration as friends. I should be happy at that. That at least means that it won't ruin our relationship. But I don't want that.

It just feels like... I'm alone, in this mental warfare. The escapade that comes with the dreams of hearing the words, "I love you too," or "I want to be with you" are what keep me going. Day by day. Yet, I also know that if I sit on this for too long, these feelings will drown themselves out, and our relationship will forever stay as friends. Once again, I should be happy with this. Yet, I don't want that.

## Ch 4) I am humbly god.... I think?
All my life, I've been able to triumph. Through my lowest of lows, and through my highest of highs, I've been able to learn new things. Apply new things. Teach new things. We can call this "character development." I've ventured in the fields of electrical engineering, biomedical engineering, HVAC technician work, mechanics, design, photography, TV production, software engineering. I can confidently say that I'm a jack of all trades, but a master of none. This becomes a double edged sword, though.

If I divulge too much of my knowledge, everyone starts to see me as some omniscent being. Now I have to maintain my image of being able to do everything, know everything, be everything. Some people find this rewarding. I find this to be a personal hell. Yes, I like knowing about a variety of topics, yes I absolutely love helping people, and yes, I love it when people seek me for advice. Yet, I loathe it when I get placed on a pedestal. Why? Why must others see me like this? I'm not different from them. I'm just a person learning new things.

### I'm just human.

Anyone has the opportunity to be omniscent. Everyone has the chance to know a little bit about everything. It's all about how they apply themselves, though. I've effectively turned myself into a social recluse because I *needed to*. I have been days aways from homelessness. I've had to join the military just to be able to provide for my mother and myself. I've had to risk my life, getting sent to a land thousands of miles away just to give myself the possibility of a better future. I've forced myself to become an expert in many fields just to be able to say that I have multiple backup plans in case one field fails. Yet, the biggest, and least obvious drawback of this is being viewed as a god.

### I'm just human.

Having to maintain this farce of being a perfect being, that nothing is wrong with me, and that everything is going swell in my life is tiring. It's exhausting. It's depressing. I don't want to be "Jose, who literally doesn't know how not to answer a question."

### I'm just human
\
I've decided to start letting my emotions shows. I've decided to mess up a little bit. I've decided to actively try to be *human.* I laugh, I cry, I share my emotions with 3 people. I want those 3 people to be there for the rest of my life. I want them to be part of my minute social circle where I can tell them anything, and not have to worry aobut them saying "wow, I never thought you'd say/consider that" or "wow, I never knew you can feel like that."

### I'm just human
\
I want them to be part of my two friend groups that I can go to whenever I'm happy, whenver I'm sad, whenever I'm depressed, whenever I have amazing news to share. I just want to be human.
