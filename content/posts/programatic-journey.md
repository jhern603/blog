## A Start with no Starting Line
Picture this, a 225 lbs 19-year-old college student, who like most college students, have a dollar to their name and a box of cup noodles. That would be the "typical," romanticized college student. However, I wasn't a typical college student, I was jobless, and one month away from being homeless. "But don't you live with your parents?" I did and still do. However, I live with my mother, and my father passed away. My mother has no formal education, didn't have a job at the time, and couldn't get a job at the time. So where does that put me? As a "I'm survivng purely off of scholarships and student loans." However, I decided to only take out one, small student loan because I didn't want to find myself encumbered under a mountain of student debt. I also wasn't a star student in high school, and had barely passing grades for the first half of my college career. What does this mean?

I have no money, and there is no source of income in my household. That means that the start of my adulthood had no starting line. I didn't have the luxury of most people of not having to worry about paying for utilities, rent, food, nonetheless school. However, I also thought that money would just magically spawn, allowing me to continue to study without worries. The realization of "you have to earn money" hit me when I was halfway through a semester, and we started to fall through with bills. The logical next step was to start applying to jobs.
