## A Start with no Starting Line
Picture this, a 225 lbs 19-year-old college student, who like most "typical," romanticized college students, have a dollar to their name and a box of cup noodles. However, I wasn't a typical college student, I was jobless, and one month away from being homeless. My parents don't have formal education, and were both jobless as well. This made me rely purely on scholarships and student loans in order to survive. However, I decided to only take out one, small student loan because I didn't want to find myself encumbered under a mountain of student debt, and didn't have many scholarships. I also wasn't a star student in high school, and had barely passing grades for the first half of my college career because I was too busy worrying about what, and if I was even going to eat the next day.

I had no money, and no source of income in my household. That means that the start of my adulthood had no starting line. I didn't have the luxury of most people of not having to worry about paying for utilities, rent, food, nonetheless school. However, I also thought that money would just magically spawn, allowing me to continue to studying without worries. The realization of "you have to earn money" hit me when I was halfway through a semester, and my family started to miss the due dates on many bills. The logical next step was to start applying to jobs.

## Fast Food is a Fast No
So began the next phase of survival, job hunting. I would go to apply to hundreds of places, from grocery stores, to retail stores. From photography studios, to cell phone stores. All of which would respond with a resounding "we have decided to not move forward with your application." The time was ticking to my inevitable "we have to move out and have nowhere to go" nightmare. Notice, though, I didn't mention fast food joints. 

That was on purpose, my mother worked at a McDonald's for half a year, and after seeing how hard she would have to work for minimum wage, I decided, "I will never work fast food in my life." With much respect to those that do, I personally couldn't fathom having to work 4 hours, moving non-stop, with orders constantly going through, management breathing down your neck because you didn't make a burger in 0.004 seconds, and having to deal with customers screaming at you because they asked for large fries, not medium fries. All of this for a measely 8.25USD an hour. After your standard deductions (taxes), it's really about 6.74USD an hour. That would mean I would have to work 80 hours just to make 539USD. 539USD would go directly to cover part of my utilities, not even rent.

Is it really worth working like a dog just to earn enough to not even cover half of your expenses? Not at all. With that in mind, and all the rejection emails in my inbox, my options were running slim. It pretty much boiled down to being homeless, or joining the military.

## The Army Life is Crazy
Who wouldn't take a job that has guaranteed job security, free health benefits, a guaranteed roof over your head, and you never have to worry about food? The correct answer would be nobody. However, that answer changes quickly when you mention "the military." Sure, the military isn't easy. It was never meant to be easy. Yet, it still exists. The military is there to challenge your point of view on the world. The military is there to challenge you mentally and physically. The military is there to exist like a blanket that says, "don't worry about money, housing, or food. We have you covered."

If you look past the strange societal norms in the military and toxic leadership (which are both really hard to do), it becomes easier to swallow the pill of joining the miltiary for benefits. That's what I did. Additionally, a majority of people, if not, many people think that the military has to become your entire personality trait. That's not entirely correct. There are different branches, and different components. There's active duty, the reserves, and the national guard.

Whats the different between these? Active duty is you're in the military full time. The reserves and national guard are more akin to part-time gigs. Another thing is, and this holds especially true if you join the reserves or national guard, your job prospects are much higher than the active duty counterparts.

Bearing all of this in mind, I decided to take the plunge and join the Army Reserves. Boy was it the best decision I ever made. I went through a year of training, but graduated and went back home and got a job within 3 months of graduating. I never though it was possible. I was reaching the light at the end of the tunnel.

However, living expenses decided to slap me across the face by becoming more expensive, so that nice new job I just landed was almost for naught. I decided, I need to go back to school.

## Time to get Edumacated, Again
I'm going to fast forward this story by 3 years. I'm coming back from Iraq and now I have some sweat new benefits from the government. New to me at least. It's called the Post 9/11 G.I. Bill. What does this benefit do? It pays for me to go to school, and it pays for my living expenses. Therefore, I can officially say that I get paid to go to school. Wow, sweet!

"Sounds like a happy ending, so let's wrap it up!"

Is what I would say if there weren't a little more to add to the story. I'm now 23, a military veteran, going back to school. Keeping in mind everything that I've said before, I am practically an atypical college student now. But, I prefer being the atypical student. Because I have been exposed to the real-world, I know what it is like to have responsibilities. I know what it is like to have to pay bills, and how sitting around and partying doesn't really benefit me much. That is not to say that I don't have any hobbies, I do, but I prioritize things differently now.

Having set myself up for success, I decided to start a career path in software engineering by studying computer science. Time to get a black hoodie, some shades, and stare at a computer screen for 8 hours a day! At least that's what they show in the movies. Of course, that's not really the case in school. It's more about going knees-deep into textbooks, technical documentation, and understanding the idea of "think like a computer," than it is actual programming. That's a good thing, though. A good engineer spends time honing their craft. A good engineer also seeks to improve their work, and themselves.

## The Cloud? Like, in the Sky?
I went on a journey of self-improvement while in school by teaching myself a ton of new technical skills. Of course, related to programming. I learned about object-oriented programming, inheritance, and much more. "But, Jose, isn't most of that stuff things you learn in programming 1?" Yes, but, shut up. I felt like I was Einstein because I was learning these things 3 days before they were actually taught in class, which then turned into me tutoring my entire class on those same topics. But guess what? I thought that was just enough to get my foot in the door and start applying to internships. So that's what I did.

FAANG; Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google. The most known names in the world of tech. The names that people conjure up first when they think what companies exist in tech. It also happens to be part of everybody's list of "companies I would love to work for." Mine are: None. I don't have a dream company. Why? Because all I'm loooking for is to be comfortable. That also means that I wouldn't be mad if I got an acceptance letter from some bizarre company nobody has ever heard of.

Over 200 applications. That's the typical amount of applications a student submits when they are searching for an internship. For the first time in my life, I was part of something typical. This felt exciting, up until 200 applications were quickly turning into 200 rejection emails. I was slowly beginning to panic. "Am I not good enough? Did I mess up by going into software engineering? Why am I getting turned down?" These questions boil down to what is commonly known "imposter syndrome."

As the number of rejection emails started getting closer to the number of applications I sent, I was losing hope. All until one company saw some potential. That company turned out to be Oracle.

I was being interviewed for the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. I had no idea how the cloud worked, so how the heck am I even supposed to join a team who lives in the cloud? Oracle didn't care. I went through 4 interviews in the span of 2 weeks. Then the waiting began. Some days went by, my anxiety was killing me. It felt like I was waiting for the final season of Futurama to air. Then, I get a phone call.

"Hi Jose! I'm [redacted] from Oracle. We would love to extend an offer for you to join this summer as an intern!" This opening statement felt like somebody just lifted 3 cars off of my shoulders. The call that everyone dreams about. With it being the only offer I had, I had no other option but to say yes.

I am now a Software Engineer Intern for Oracle's Cloud Infrastructure. Years of stressing about being homeless was gone. My time in the military is paying off. My (at the time) small amount of programming knowledge from school is going to be put to use. I am inevitable. I am an engineer.

## Where I'm at Today
Fast forward three years to present time. I am now a senior in college. I'm 25, am the proud owner of a car, have an ungodly expensive hobby, and am also teaching people how to take their negative experiences, and turn it into something positive. I am a three-time returning intern at Oracle, and yes, Java is my favorite programming language.

What was the point of this long, drawn out post? It was to demonstrate that regardless of your background, regardless of the adversities you face, and challenges that life throws at you, there is always hope. If you decide to throw in the towel and quit trying, then you have lost the game of life. Life is not meant to be easy, or straightforward. There will be people you meet that are better off than you, and there will always be someone out there in the world, that is in a worse position than you are currently in. If you are able to realize that, and push past your comfort zone, then you will become successful. You will do things that you would have never imagined doing.
