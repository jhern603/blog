So you have an internship, and you're looking to return to the company. This may be your first, second, or even third internship. What should you do?

Should you push thousands of lines of code a day, and open up all the PRs in the world? Should you be finding day-zero bugs all day long, and patch them? No, you shouldn't be doing either. Increasing your chances at a return offer is simpler than you would think, and it doesn't involve being a programming wizard. Yes, you were brought on to do one thing, and that's to engineer. That has to be done regardless, but if all you strictly do is code, then don't expect a "we would love to bring you back" email.

Below are some tips to get a return offer!
